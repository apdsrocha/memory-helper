> A super tiny project to help me practice React

I had a briefing in hand and tried to fill the requirements to the best of my abilities using React. This was also a chance to put together a layout with all the UX and UI shenanigans I like studying so much :)  If you're interested in a more detailed tale of how that came together, I made a few slides about the entire[ process](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kX2Edc0Rub0VUL5kWMHoPZZrNxO_U-HRm0FW9HZNmnI/edit?usp=sharing)

Basically this is a web app that lets you record memory snippets and have them associated with a city (of your chosing or automatically set if you allow your browser to share location info), bringing in the current weather and date of entry. It should look good on every screen size and particularly nifty on cell phones.

## Installing / Getting started

You should be able to browse it locally after downloading the project, entering your Open Weather API Key (more details in the section API reference below) in the EntryWeather component file, and then running `npm install` followed by `npm start`. The project should open on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), enabling view it in the browser.  If you'd like to checkout the deployed version, I've set it up [ here. ](https://silly-borg-178afb.netlify.com/)
